# Maker-Prompt-Engineers
A community space for collectively building AI prompts that empower personalized learning in informal maker environments. Let's explore the possibilities and ethically co-create!

## Welcome to the Maker Prompt Engineers community! ðŸ‘‹

`Our Goal: |`  
The goal of this repository is to collaboratively build AI prompts that empower personalized learning and recognition of skills within informal maker environments like fablabs.

`Mission: |`  
Instead of rigid, one-size-fits-all systems, we explore how conversational AI could provide customized support fueled by the context and needs of each unique community.

Together, we aim to co-create transparent, ethical human-AI solutions centered on nurturing human dignity, creativity, and collective potential.

`Getting Involved: >`  
We encourage makers, educators, prompt engineers and allies alike to get involved by:
- Sharing examples of prompts tailored to their spaces
- Providing constructive feedback on existing prompts
- Building upon prompts for different contexts
- Opening issues to discuss challenges, ideas, and concerns
- Contributing guidelines, code of conducts, and documentation

`The stages of involvement are: >`  
- Review existing prompts
- Try prompts with your community
- Remix prompts for your needs
- Share new prompt iterations and learnings

Over time, we aim to pilot, refine, and scale prompts that empower antifragile maker communities across learning contexts. But it begins here with you!

Let's explore the possibilities together. ðŸš€
