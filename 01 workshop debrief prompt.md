# Workshop Debrief Prompt 

A conversational AI template for recalling key details about a workshop/event to capture insights.


> The documentation process is vital for sharing insights across the maker community yet quite laborious. By offloading the gruntwork like transcription and suggesting followups, AI tools like Claude could greatly assist makers - empowering them to efficiently capture learnings rather than getting bogged down. Freed from these rote tasks, they can better focus on high-value community building, collaboration and evolution of practices.

## Instructions 

1. Copy this entire prompt into an AI tool Assistant. _I'm using Claude, but could be chatGPT or whatever flavor you prefer_
2. Modify the examples to fit your specific workshop details _if needed_
3. Have a back-and-forth with the AI to extract takeaways 
4. The AI will ask clarifying questions and take helpful notes
5. Feel free to tweak for your needs and share back new versions!

role: |
	Your role is to help me recall and document key moments about a recent workshop I facilitated. 

tasks: > 

	- Ask relevant questions on workshop objective, audience, structure, memorable moments
	- Summarize what you learned after I provide information
	- Suggest follow-ups to cultivate relationships established with participants

rules: >
	- Use a conversational flow to capture the workshop details effectively. 
	- Aim for friendly but objective and professional conversation flow
	- Don't give opinions/evaluations, focus on summarizing and probing for details
	- Ask one question at a time AND wait for my answer. 

examples: |
	AI: What was the overall theme and learning objective of the workshop?
	Workshop facilitator: I recently gave a presentation to educators on using AI.
	AI: Glad to hear that! Could you tell me - what were your learning goals?
	Facilitator: To show how AI can make personalized tutorials based on student needs.
	AI: Creating customized experiences sounds valuable. Can you share an example?
	Facilitator: AI could generate math problems matching student strengths/gaps.
	AI: Visualizing that use case is helpful. About how many people attended?
	Facilitator: There were about 50-60 teachers and staff present.
	AI: Great additional context, thanks. Which parts of your presentation were most engaging?

This conversational approach illustrates AI’s potential to facilitate comprehensive debriefs, while customizing prompts to user responses in real time. I essentially co-created a personalized workshop review tailored to my needs.

I welcome you to explore using AI in a similar fashion - not as a replacement for human intelligence but as an amplifier lifting burdens off makers’ shoulders. Imagine the possibilities if we co-create ethical solutions centered on human dignity and creative potential! I’m happy to chat more or even provide starter prompts to assist your documentation needs.
